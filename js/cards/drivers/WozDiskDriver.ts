     * Spin the disk under the read/write head for WOZ images.
     *
     * This implementation emulates every clock cycle of the 2 MHz
     * sequencer since the last time it was called in order to
     * determine the current state. Because this is called on
     * every access to the softswitches, the data in the latch
     * will be correct on every read.
     *
     * The emulation of the disk makes a few simplifying assumptions:
     *
     * *   The motor turns on instantly.
     * *   The head moves tracks instantly.
     * *   The length (in bits) of each track of the WOZ image
     *     represents one full rotation of the disk and that each
     *     bit is evenly spaced.
     * *   Writing will not change the track length. This means
     *     that short tracks stay short.
     * *   The read head picks up the next bit when the sequencer
     *     clock === 4.
     * *   Head position X on track T is equivalent to head position
     *     X on track Tâ€². (This is not the recommendation in the WOZ
     *     spec.)
     * *   Unspecified tracks contain a single zero bit. (A very
     *     short track, indeed!)
     * *   Two zero bits are sufficient to cause the MC3470 to freak
     *     out. When freaking out, it returns 0 and 1 with equal
     *     probability.
     * *   Any softswitch changes happen before `moveHead`. This is
     *     important because it means that if the clock is ever
     *     advanced more than one cycle between calls, the
     *     softswitch changes will appear to happen at the very
     *     beginning, not just before the last cycle.
